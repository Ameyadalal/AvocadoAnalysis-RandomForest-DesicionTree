# AvocadoAnalysis-RandomForest-DesicionTree
• This project aims to classify the types of the Avocado based on the attributes from the given data.

• The algorithms used for this classification are Random Forest which is implemented using R programming and it's libraries.

• The code is not divided into number of files, it is present only in Avocado.R file. The file Avocado.R contains main function, which invokes functions to train the model from scratch and then use the trained model to identify types on the given input data.

• A model trained using train and test function is saved and the final class analysis of the machine learning models are also stored. This file is used to restore the model state when new data is given as input to the model for classification.

• The details of Random Forest architecture including are given in the project report file. This model achieved an F1 score of 0.89 (89%) when evaluated using test dataset.
